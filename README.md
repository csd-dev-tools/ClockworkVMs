# VmBuilder
PyQt wrapper for public cloud templates and packer

VmBuilder provides the ability to download and minimally re-configure cloud templates for building virtual machines.  The first repositories that will be available via this method are the https://github.com/boxcutter repositories:

https://github.com/boxcutter/ubuntu
https://github.com/boxcutter/debian
https://github.com/boxcutter/bsd
https://github.com/boxcutter/centos
https://github.com/boxcutter/oraclelinux
https://github.com/boxcutter/macos
https://github.com/boxcutter/fedora

The application should work on all systems that have a functional install of Python 2.7 and PyQt 5.  The macos repository will only work on a system that is running macOS.
